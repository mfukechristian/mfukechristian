#   Hi, I'm Christian Mfuke 👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

I'm that Full Stack Developer you've heard whispers about..., I used to design air conditioning, so I know how to handle pressure 💨.

###   👨🏾‍💻 What I Do:

-   Front-End Wizardry: ✨ I make pixels dance and users smile (most of the time).
-   Back-End Sorcery: 🧙‍♂️ I build the server-side stuff that keeps the magic alive.
-   Full Stack Shenanigans: 🎭 I juggle both, because I CAN

###   💻 My Arsenal:

-   **Front-End:**
    -   React.js ⚛️ (my weapon of choice)
    -   JavaScript 📜 (the OG)
    -   TypeScript ✍️ (for when I'm feeling fancy)
    -   HTML 🦴 (bones)
    -   CSS 🎨 (style)
    -   Bootstrap 👢 & Material UI 💄 (for when I need to look sharp)
-   **Back-End:**
    -   Node.js 🚀 (fast & furious)
    -   Express.js 🛤️ (Node's trusty sidekick)
    -   C# 🧲 & .NET 🌐 (the enterprise power-up)
    -   RESTful APIs 🗣️ (because everyone needs to talk)
-   **Databases:**
    -   PostgreSQL 🐘 & MongoDB 🍃 (I speak both SQL and NoSQL... it's a gift 🎁)
-   **AI Tools:**
    -   Langchain 🔗 (making friends with AI)
    -   OpenAI 🧠 & Gemini ♊ (chatting with the big brains)
    -   Ollama & Groq 😎 (the cool kids on the block)
-   **Cloud:**
    -   AWS ☁️ (I play in the cloud)
    -   Vercel ⚡ (for quick getaways)
-   **DevOps:**
    -   Git ⏳ (my time machine)
    -   GitHub 🐙 (my portfolio playground)
    -   Docker 🐳 (packing up code)
    -   GitHub Actions ⚙️ & CI/CD 🔄 (automating the boring stuff)
    -   Agile/Scrum 🏃 (because I play well with others)
    -   Jira 🎫 (ticket tracker of doom... but I manage)
-   **Other:**
    -   Python 🐍 & Flask 🍾 (for quick scripts and web snacks)
